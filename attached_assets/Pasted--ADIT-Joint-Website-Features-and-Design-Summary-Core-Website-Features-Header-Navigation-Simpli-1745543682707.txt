Technical Implementation Details
Database Structure:
PostgreSQL database is configured but not fully utilized yet
Schema defined in shared/schema.ts for products, services, industries, etc.
Database connection handled through Drizzle ORM
API Architecture:
RESTful API endpoints defined in server/routes.ts
All API routes prefixed with /api/
Includes endpoints for products, services, industries, contacts, leads, marketing, etc.
Authentication & Authorization:
Admin routes protected with requireAdmin middleware
Authentication system is partially implemented but needs completion
No default credentials exist yet - would need to be created
Backend Services:
Email sending functionality via the server/email.ts module
Currently configured but may need email service credentials
Image & Media Handling:
Images stored in client/public folder
Video files stored in client/public/videos
No CDN integration currently
Business Logic & Workflows
Approval Workflows:
Partner applications require admin approval (endpoint: /api/partners/:id/approve)
Advisor applications have similar approval process
Lead and contact status management functionality
Marketing Analytics:
Backend endpoints for marketing analytics exist but frontend implementation is minimal
Includes lead source tracking, campaign performance metrics
Content Management:
Site settings stored in database and retrieved via API
Default settings defined in client/src/lib/defaultSiteSettings.ts
Development Notes
Local Development:
Uses Vite for frontend development with HMR (Hot Module Replacement)
Express server for backend with automatic restart
Database access through environment variables
Build Process:
Not fully configured for production deployment
Would need proper environment configuration for production settings
Future Expansion Areas:
Authentication system completion
Admin dashboard implementation
Email integration with service credentials
Full implementation of marketing analytics
More robust error handling
Potential Integrations:
No third-party services currently integrated
Payment gateway integration may be needed for future features
SaaS product showcase would benefit from demo integration
Maintenance Considerations
Content Updates:
Need admin interface for easy content management
News and events would need regular updates
Partner and advisor listings require moderation
Security Aspects:
Database credentials managed through environment variables
Admin routes protected but authentication system incomplete
CSRF protection and rate limiting not implemented
Performance Optimization:
Large video file may impact initial load time
Image optimization could be improved
Server-side rendering not implemented
